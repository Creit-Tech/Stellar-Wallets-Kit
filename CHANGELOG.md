### Fix
- Move the Modal component out from the Button component, we do this so the shadow DOM styles don't affect the modal component in those cases where there is a container that could prevent the modal from taking the whole screen

### Change
- Use xBull Wallet Connect npm package instead of the github version, this way some lints don't trigger an error.

### Change
- Upgrade all dependencies, lock them and remove those that are not used anymore.

### Add
- Add the latest version of the Freighter API and update the calls to the API.
- Add a new `Button` component. This new component can show the selected address, and the current XLM balance allows copying the chosen address and allows the user to "disconnect".
- Allow listening to both "connect" and "disconnect" Button events
- Add a new state to the kit, so we can keep the current balance and picked address to show in the Button component.
- Add a new plugin to the build process, so it minimizes the distribution build.
- Add a new development server to make the development of the kit easier.

#### Change
- Wallets/services are now handled as "modules" (a module is basically a driver for a wallet/service) and they all share a common interface. This way wallets' developers can create their own modules and make their products compatible with this kit.
- BREAKING: Modules now need to be imported when starting the kit, a function called `allowAllModules` is included and this one will inject all the builtin modules 
- BREAKING: When creating a new instance of `StellarWalletsKit`, you now send the wallet id (provided either by this kit or by the third party module) instead of `WalletType`.
- BREAKING: When using the modal, you need to pass the id of the selected wallet instead of the type. Check `README.md` for an example
- BREAKING: `allowedWallets` is no longer a valid parameter for the integrated modal, instead the modal uses the modules from the kit.
- BREAKING: WalletConnect support has been dropped, the integration got outdated and needs to be upgraded before we add it again.
